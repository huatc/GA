    "\n",
    "This package contains code to run a genetic algorithm. Because the algorithm is computationally inexpensive, it is useful for optimizations where the objective function can be queried many times such as hyperparameter tuning or fitting a model. This genetic algorithm contains four steps:\n",

    "- **Evaluation:** Sorting the candidates based on their fitness score\n",
    "- **Selection:** Selecting the candidates that are passed to the next round according to their fitness score. This algorithm uses a roulette wheel approach, where the probability of being selected is proportional to the candidate's fitness\n",
    "- **Crossover:** The information from two candidates that were selected from the previous step are randomly shuffled between each other to form \"offspring\" candidates \n",
    "- **Mutation:** A random change in the offspring candidates is introduced which is controlled by a hyperparameter. A mutation rate closer to 0 will favor exploitation and a mutation rate closer to 1 will favor exploration \n",

    "The best way to use this algorithm is to open the jupyter notebook called Run_GA.ipynb and follow the example given in the notebook.\n"
